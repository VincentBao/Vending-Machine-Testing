# Vending-Machine-Testing

1. Model-based testing of the VendingMachine class
Show that 2-transition sequence testing has been satisfied. Identify all 2-transition
sequences. For each 2-transition sequence indicate which test in the test suite (TS.txt
file) executes this 2-transition sequence. If a given 2-tranistion sequence is not
executable, you need to explain why it is non-executable.
2. Testing default (ghost) transitions of the VendingMachine class
Show that default transition testing has been satisfied. Identify all default transitions in
every state. For each default transition indicate which test in the test suite executes this
default transition.
3. Multiple-condition testing
Show that multiple-condition testing has been satisfied in all methods. Identify all
multiple-conditions/branches in the implementation (source-code) of the
VendingMachine class. For each multiple-condition/branch indicate which test in the
test suite (TS.txt file) executes this multiple-condition/branch. If a given multiplecondition
is not executable, you need to explain why it is non-executable. Notice that
if a predicate contains only a simple condition, the multiple-condition testing is
equivalent to the branch testing for this predicate.
4. A Test Suit and the results of its execution
In this section you need to provide a hardcopy of the test suite (TS.txt file). In
addition, you need to execute the test suite. During the execution of the test suite, the
results produced by the VendingMachine class need to be recorded/documented and
provided in this section. For each test case you need to validate the results and
determine whether the VendingMachine class produced the correct results. If for a
given test case the results are incorrect (test failed), identify the cause of incorrectness
(a defect) in the source code of the VendingMachine class.
5. Conclusions
In this part of the report, you should describe your experience with the implementation
of the testing environment and its usage in class testing and model-based testing.
Describe which activities related to class testing can be automated or partially
automated.
6. Well documented source code of the VendingMachine class and the test driver(s).
